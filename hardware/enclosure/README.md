# Enclosure

The 3D-printable combadge enclosure for the electronics to sit inside. 3D design is done in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

I couldn't find any official combadge dimensions online, so I based my dimensions off of numbers given in this [forum thread](https://www.therpf.com/forums/threads/dimensions-of-star-trek-communicator-badge.266118/).

The PCB is a `45mm x 31mm` ellipse with some parts lopped off where required.
The enclosure's ellipse is `47.5mm x 33.5mm`. Walls are `1mm` thick, with a `0.5mm` room for error around the edge of the cavity for the electronics.

The chevron is extruded from an [SVG](chevron.svg) traced with Inkscape from a bitmap.
