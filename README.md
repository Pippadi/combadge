This project is still in its early stages. For more information, feel free to explore the directory tree. It's not very big.

A good place to start is [hardware/pcb](hardware/pcb), followed by [software/combadge](software/combadge).
Code used for testing/developing individual components of the system can be found under [software/test](software/test).
The 3D-printable enclosure can be found at [hardware/enclosure](hardware/enclosure).

This is a hobby project I am pursuing in order to broaden my knowledge and experience with embedded electronics and programming.
And of course, to end up with a combadge better than the ones they used on TV (I believe those are just molded and painted resin).
Please bear in mind that I am a beginner, especially when it comes to the electronics (remember that before you plug the batteries in).

Suggestions, tips, and contributions are welcome!
I hope that with some (of your?) time and effort, this combadge can grow to become more useful than a block of resin, while still retaining the charm.

All the tools used for this (as seen in the READMEs throughout the project) are free and open-source. Thank you to those that made this possible!
